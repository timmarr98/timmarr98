### Hello there! I am Timothy Marr 

I am a Software Engineer and Computer Science graduate from Florida International Unversity. 
<br>
<br>
Using programming as a tool to solve problems and automate tasks is my specialty.

- ‚ö° Fun fact: I created an entirely automated <a href = "https://seniorproject.cis.fiu.edu/seniorprojects/efort-efst/"> FOREX Scalping trading bot </a> that has been profitable (+ $1,100) in the past year!

### Skills
I primarily code with Python, Java and Dart (Flutter). I love working with REST API's and collecting data!

### Currently working on
<ul>
  <li>
  CalmMe : An anxiety welness app (Flutter) üçÉ
  </li>
  <li>
    InfoBot: A discord bot that gives users a profile section, games, etc!
  </li>
</ul>
